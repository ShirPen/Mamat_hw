1. The main place where we can see identical code that has been reused is most of the C files. The main section of the code is used to 
   check if the input for the C file is valid, and what to do if not. The only real distinction between each C file is the contents
   of the operate function, where each operate function is what we want the C file to "actually do," for example the contents of
   the operate function in mean.c is used to calculate the mean of the input. In order to create a more efficient code and 
   take away the repetiton, we could create an additional C file, for example one called "input_check.c" which takes care of the 
   input check. This would take away most of the code in each C file and save the repetition.
   
2. There is no promise that the numbers generated will be uniform in any way. The command given generates a random number between 0
   and 655535, and then takes the modulus with 100 in order to get a number between 0 and 99. However, because the command is random,
   when we run the command in a loop there is no guarantee to the amount of times each number shows up, and there may occur instances
   where one number shows up more times than another, thus ruining any change of uniformity.
